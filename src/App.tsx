/*
  Connectr frontend boilerplate

  Below is an potential starter to your app.
  Please feel free to remove any components, code, libraries in this boilerplate if it doesn't work with your solution.

  We use 'styled-components' at Connectr but please feel free to use whatever styling library or conventions you are more comfortable with.

  Below is the criteria we will be looking at so please keep them in mind when implementing your solution.

  - Coding style, i.e. your approach not whether you use semicolons or not ;)
  - Usability. Although the design doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to be polished we expect the app to be usable without the user needing to read this document
  - Your overall solution approach
  - Maintainability and extensibility
  - Use of responsive design
  - Web Accessibility. Anyone should be able to use it.
  - Meeting the requirements
